# Serenity OS build

## How to build

To add this to the serenity OS system, you have to build the port for it.


Copy `platforms/serenity/package.sh` to `Ports/oopetris/package.sh`, create the directory `Ports/oopetris/` and add the file to it.

Then just `cd` into the directory and run the `package.sh`, like with all other Serenity OS ports.


## NOTE

We don't have a CI for this port, so please report errors, if you find some.
