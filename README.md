![Code Coverage](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mgerhold/oopetris/_xml_coverage_reports/data/main/badge.svg)

## What is this?

This is a cross-platform [Tetris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris) implementation in C++.
It is written in [OOP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming)-style using [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/).

## Platform support

This officially supports Linux, Windows, MacOS, Android, Serenity OS, Nintendo Switch and Nintendo 3DS.

Why these? Because it was fun to port the application to those platforms ðŸ˜‹

## Usage

You can self-build the application easily.

For concrete instructions see [here](docs/develop.md)

Or you can download and use prebuilt binaries from the CI-builds. You can find supported platforms here:
